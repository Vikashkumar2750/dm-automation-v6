# DM FB-IG-YT by Techaasvik — Build Roadmap

Source of truth: `DM_FB_IG_YT_Techaasvik_Master_PRD_Phasewise.md` (uploaded PRD).
Decisions: build on Lovable, keep code portable for a later Railway export.
Real Meta + YouTube credentials are available when we reach OAuth phases.

- [x] Phase 0 — Product foundation (PRD supplied by user, tokens + IA derived)
- [x] Phase 1 — Design system + app shell (sidebar, topbar, switchers, primitives, dashboard shell)
- [x] Phase 2 — Multi-tenant core + auth + security (orgs, roles, RLS, login/signup, protected routes)
- [x] Phase 3 — Social OAuth & Account Center (Meta credentials live; YouTube pending Google credentials)
- [x] Phase 4 — Webhook / event gateway (Meta callback, signature check, event feed)
- [x] Phase 5 — Instagram messaging foundation
- [x] Phase 6 — Facebook messaging & comment automation (public reply, private DM from comment, hide comment)
- [x] Phase 7 — Unified inbox + comments (search, platform/type/status filters, unread-only, status controls)
- [x] Phase 8 — Automation engine V1 (keyword rules, auto-reply, cooldown + daily cap, run log)
- [x] Phase 9 — Response variations + safety engine (rotating replies, kill switch, blocked + opt-out words, quiet hours, per-contact cap)
- [x] Phase 10 — Rate limit / quota / viral protection (org hourly+daily caps, spike auto-pause, usage panel)
- [x] Phase 11 — Publishing & content calendar (composer, scheduling, month calendar, publish queue + cron endpoint)
- [x] Team management (invites, roles, remove) — Phase 2 leftover
- [x] Publishing upgrade — multi-account publish in one go, media upload (image/video/carousel), reel + story formats
- [ ] Phase 12 — YouTube (blocked: Google Client ID + Secret needed)
- [x] Phase 13 — AI layer (caption writer, reply drafts, automation rule suggestions)
- [x] Phase 14 — Analytics & ROI (engagement, reply speed, automation share, publishing results)
- [x] Phase 15 — Super admin / operations (workspaces, plans, platform stats, event health)
- [x] Phase 16 — Agency / white label (workspace branding, logo, brand colour, support email, client workspaces)
- [ ] Export pack for Railway (Dockerfile, env template, migration runner)
