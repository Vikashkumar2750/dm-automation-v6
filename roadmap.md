# DM FB-IG-YT by Techaasvik — Build Roadmap

Source of truth: `DM_FB_IG_YT_Techaasvik_Master_PRD_Phasewise.md` (uploaded PRD).
Decisions: build on Lovable, keep code portable for a later Railway export.
Real Meta + YouTube credentials are available when we reach OAuth phases.

- [x] Phase 0 — Product foundation (PRD supplied by user, tokens + IA derived)
- [x] Phase 1 — Design system + app shell (sidebar, topbar, switchers, primitives, dashboard shell)
- [x] Phase 2 — Multi-tenant core + auth + security (orgs, roles, RLS, login/signup, protected routes)
- [x] Phase 3 — Social OAuth & Account Center (Meta credentials live; YouTube pending Google credentials)
- [x] Phase 4 — Webhook / event gateway (Meta callback, signature check, event feed)
- [x] Phase 5 — Instagram messaging foundation
- [x] Phase 6 — Facebook messaging & comment automation (public reply, private DM from comment, hide comment)
- [x] Phase 7 — Unified inbox + comments (search, platform/type/status filters, unread-only, status controls)
- [x] Phase 8 — Automation engine V1 (keyword rules, auto-reply, cooldown + daily cap, run log)
- [x] Phase 9 — Response variations + safety engine (rotating replies, kill switch, blocked + opt-out words, quiet hours, per-contact cap)
- [ ] Phase 10 — Rate limit / quota / viral protection
- [ ] Phase 11 — Publishing & content calendar
- [ ] Phase 12 — YouTube
- [ ] Phase 13 — AI layer
- [ ] Phase 14 — Analytics & ROI
